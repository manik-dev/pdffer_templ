In recent years the browser support for the acrobat pdf plugin is on the downfall. All major browsers today like chrome, firefox, internet explorer and safari don't support it anymore. Due to this the Acro Forms are not working on the browser. Many companies are struggling to find the support. This is a small attempt to create a hybrid application that allows user to fill html form and then populate the pdf form with that data. This application is a client side solution to the problem and doesn't need server side logic to function.
